# DeepLearning
 
This repository has python code for projects aimed at becoming better at deep learning.

# Logistic Regression
This includes code for binary and multinomial logistic regression.

# FCNNs
This includes implementing FCNNs from scratch followed by using pytorch.
SVM is also implemented using scikit-learn to compare the results.
Finally models are evaluated using the MNIST data set.

# CNNs
This includes implementation of a minimalistic CNN framework.
In addidtion CNNs are implemented using pytorch on MNIST and CIFAR datasets.

# RNNs
This includes implemntation of sentiment analysis for Stanford dataset using RNNs, LSTMs and GRUs.
Bahdanau attention for sequence classification is also implemented.

# MetricEmbedding
This includes implementation of metric embedding for classification of MNIST dataset.
