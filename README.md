# DeepLearning
 
This repository has python code for projects aimed at becoming better at deep learning.

# Logistic Regression
This includes code for binary and multinomial logistic regression.

# FCNNs
This includes implementing FCNNs from scratch followed by using pytorch.
SVM is also implemented using scikit-learn to compare the results.
Finally models are evaluated using the MNIST data set.
